OpenAI response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence write a code to perform arithmetic operations in python 
 *************************



# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations
def arithmetic_operation(operation, a, b):
    if operation == "+":
        return a + b
    elif operation == "-":
        return a - b
    elif operation == "*":
        return a * b
    elif operation == "/":
        return a / b
    else:
        return "Invalid operation"

# Take input from user
operation = input("Enter the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /): ")
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Call the function

result = arithmetic_operation(operation, num1, num2)

print("The result is ", result)
